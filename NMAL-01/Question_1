To choose a better range for the bisection method, you need to find two values a and b such that the function changes sign between them — in other words, f(a)⋅f(b)<0. This ensures that there is at least one real root in that interval. A simple way to find such a range is to try different values of x and check the sign of 𝑓(𝑥)
f(x). If the function value changes from negative to positive or vice versa between two points, that interval can be used. A better and more systematic approach is to use a loop in code to test values over a wide range (like −10 to 10) and detect where the sign change occurs. This guarantees a valid starting interval for the bisection method to work correctly.
